I didn't just manage the rollout, I researched the technology, negotiated the contracts with Intercom and OpenAI, planned contingencies for international regulations, and monitored performance metrics to optimize the system.

I understand data structures, API authentication, database relationships, and how to translate business requirements into technical implementations. If I can orchestrate complex API integrations and database management, I can absolutely handle SQL queries and BI dashboards.</p>

            <div style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7; color: var(--text-medium);">
                <p>I first learned about Attio from Elyse and Lou when I applied before. Even though I didn't get the role, they left such a positive impression that I've been following your journey ever since. When I saw you raised $52M Series B from Google Ventures in August, I knew you were entering the exact phase where someone with my experience becomes critical.</p>

                <p>What excites me most is that you're building an AI-native CRM. Not bolting AI onto an existing product, but designing the whole thing around AI from the ground up. I've been in the trenches of AI implementation. I know what works and what doesn't. I launched Intercom's Fin AI bot when it was still in alpha, dealt with the messy parts like international AI regulations, and learned how to balance automation with human touch. That experience is directly transferable to helping Attio's customers get the most out of your AI-powered platform.</p>

                <p>The other piece that resonates with me is your focus on flexibility. Traditional CRMs force companies into rigid structures. Attio's approach of adapting to how businesses actually work means your support operations need to be equally flexible and strategic. I've built support systems that scale across time zones, integrated AI that doesn't feel robotic, and created knowledge bases that actually help people. I want to do that for a product I genuinely believe is better than what's out there.</p>

                <p><strong>You're at 5,000 customers and 4x ARR growth. That's the exact inflection point where support operations becomes a competitive advantage or a bottleneck. I want to make sure it's the former.</strong></p>

            <div style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7; color: var(--text-medium);">
                <p>Here's what's changed since I applied last time: I'm building an iOS app for learning Japanese vocabulary, and it's now in the testing phase before beta launch in December.</p>

                <p>This isn't a simple project. I'm using Claude Code to manage a Firebase database, integrate multiple APIs (Claude for translation, Google Voice for text-to-speech, the JISHO Japanese dictionary API), implement the Unity game engine for 3D graphics, and track analytics with PostHog. As a non-programmer, I'm doing all of this through AI prompt engineering. I designed the architecture, debugged integration issues, managed the data models, and built a functional app that actually works.</p>

                <p>Why does this matter for a support operations role? Because if I can orchestrate Firebase databases, multiple API integrations, game engines, and analytics tracking using AI tools, I can absolutely handle SQL queries and BI dashboards. The technical concepts are the same. I understand data structures, API authentication, database relationships, and how to translate business requirements into technical implementations. Most importantly, I can evaluate and implement technical solutions myself instead of just writing requirements docs and hoping someone else figures it out.</p>

                <p>This is the technical growth you were looking for. I've spent the past year working with databases, APIs, and complex integrations. I can debug technical issues, read error logs, and have real conversations with engineers about data models and system architecture. But I also have six years of support operations experience to know which technical solutions actually help customers and which ones just look good in demos.</p>

                <p><strong>I'm not a programmer who learned support. I'm a support operations expert who learned to think like a programmer. For an AI-native CRM, that's exactly what you need.</strong></p>
