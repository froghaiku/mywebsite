# Video Talking Points for Attio Application

## Video Structure (60-90 seconds total)

### Opening Hook (25-30 seconds)
**What to say:**
"Hey Attio team, I'm Ben. I applied for this role about a year ago and you told me I wasn't technical enough. Fair feedback. So I built an iOS app from scratch using AI prompt engineering. Not because I'm a programmer, but because I wanted to prove I could handle the technical side of support operations at an AI-native company like yours."

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges the elephant in the room immediately
- Shows growth and response to feedback
- Demonstrates initiative and technical capability
- AI prompt engineering is directly relevant to an AI-native CRM

### Body: Your Unique Fit (35-40 seconds)

**Point 1: AI Implementation Experience (15-20 seconds)**
"When you raised $52M from Google Ventures in August and announced you're at 5,000 customers with 4x ARR growth, I knew this was the moment you'd need someone who's actually been in the trenches of AI support implementation. I launched Intercom's Fin AI bot when it was still in alpha at Kit.com. It saved 400 hours a month, but more importantly, I learned what actually works when you're balancing AI automation with human support."

**Point 2: Operations at Scale (15-20 seconds)**
"I've done the hard part of scaling support operations at a B2B SaaS company. I took Kit.com from 72-hour response times to under 5 minutes while growing the team 300%. I know what breaks when you scale fast, and I know how to build systems that don't."

**Why this works:**
- References specific, recent company news (shows you're following them)
- Ties your experience directly to their current growth stage
- Demonstrates understanding of AI-native support challenges
- Shows you understand their pain points

---

### Closing (15 seconds)
"I know the role. I know the tools. And this time, I have the technical chops you were looking for. Let's talk about how I can help Attio's support operations become a competitive advantage during this growth phase."

**Why this works:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Clear call to action
- Reinforces that you've addressed their previous concern
- Ties back to business value

## Authenticity Tips

### DO:
✅ Mention Elyse Mankin and Lou by name (you talked to them before)
- "When I talked to Elyse and Lou last time, they left such a positive impression that I've been following Attio ever since."

✅ Be specific about what you've learned since last application
- "I spent this year building technical skills. I didn't just read about APIs, I worked with them."

✅ Show you understand their positioning
- "AI-native isn't just a buzzword for you. It's architecture. That's why my experience launching AI support tools in production is relevant."

✅ Reference their specific language
- Use "AI-native CRM" not just "CRM"
- Mention "go-to-market builders" (their target customer language)
- Reference "programmable surfaces" or "adaptive data model"

### DON'T:
❌ Say generic things like "I'm passionate about customer success"
❌ Use buzzwords without backing them up ("synergy," "leverage," "disruptive")
❌ Pretend you know Attio's product intimately (you don't use it)
❌ Over-apologize for not getting it last time
❌ Read from a script (be conversational)

---

## Tone Guidance

**Match Attio's Culture:**
- They're a London-based, technical, fast-moving startup
- Their brand is clean, modern, and sophisticated
- They attract technical customers building at AI companies

**Your tone should be:**
- Confident but humble
- Technical but accessible
- Professional but personable
- Direct but warm

**Think:** "I'm a peer who can help" not "Please give me a chance"

---

## Things to Avoid

### ❌ Generic Phrases to Skip:
- "I'm passionate about customer experience" (show, don't tell)
- "I'm a quick learner" (everyone says this)
- "I'd be honored to work here" (too deferential)
- "Your company culture seems great" (you haven't worked there)
- "I love CRM tools" (doesn't mean anything)

### ❌ Overused Buzzwords:
- Synergy
- Leverage
- Disruptive

## Questions You Might Get Asked (Be Ready)

### Q: "You weren't technical enough last time. What changed?"
**Answer:** "I built an iOS app from scratch. I didn't just read about technical concepts, I shipped a real product. Plus, I've continued doing support ops at Circle while deepening my technical skills. I'm not a programmer, but I can read code, debug integrations, and have technical conversations with engineers without needing a translator."

### Q: "Why do you want to work at Attio specifically?"
**Answer:** "Three reasons. First, you're AI-native, not bolting AI onto legacy architecture. That matters. Second, I talked to Elyse and Lou last time and they left a great impression. And third, you're at 5,000 customers with 4x ARR growth. That's the exact inflection point where support operations becomes strategic. I want to be part of that."

### Q: "What would you do in your first 90 days?"
**Answer:** "Listen first. Then I'd audit the current support tech stack, identify the biggest friction points in customer self-service, and map out a plan for AI integration that actually helps customers instead of frustrating them. But honestly, I'd need to get in there to give you a real plan."
