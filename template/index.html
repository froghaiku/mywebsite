                <p>My path to customer success leadership wasn't traditional, and that's exactly what makes me effective.</p>

                <p>I spent 5 years running a coaching practice focused on anxiety and sports performance, hosting a podcast that reached 500,000 downloads. During that time, I learned how to truly listen, how to break down complex problems, and how to guide people toward solutions that actually work. Those skills turned out to be surprisingly transferable.</p>

                <p>When I transitioned to customer support at Kit.com, I brought that same empathy-driven, solution-focused mindset. But I also brought something else: a hunger to understand systems and scale them. I didn't just want to solve individual customer problems. I wanted to build the frameworks that would help thousands of customers succeed.</p>

                <p>That's why I led the AI integration that saved 400+ hours monthly. That's why I scaled our team by 300% while improving response times. That's why I built knowledge systems, coaching programs, and operational strategies that created lasting impact. I've always believed that the best solutions come from deeply understanding people and then building smart systems around those insights.</p>

                <p>Today, I combine deep customer empathy with technical implementation skills, strategic thinking with hands-on execution, and proven leadership experience with a genuine excitement for solving hard problems.</p>

                <p><strong>I've lived customer success, scaled it, and innovated it. And honestly? I'm just getting started.</strong></p>
